# REmibot

A multipurpose Discord bot based on a clone of [Misaki](https://github.com/NotAWeebDev/Misaki) at commit [2e44f9e](https://github.com/NotAWeebDev/Misaki/commit/2e44f9efb467028dcbae5a2c9f836d2e99860b85)

## Requirements

- `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) | [Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) | [MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
- `node` [Version 8.0.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org)

You also need your bot's token. This is obtained by creating an application in
the Developer section of discordapp.com. Check the [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide/getting-started/the-long-version.html)
for more info.

## Downloading

In a command prompt in your projects folder (wherever that may be) run the following:

`git clone https://github.com/jwchen1259/REmibot.git`

Once finished:

In the folder from where you ran the git command, run `cd REmibot` and then run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if that's your thing), which will install the required packages,
and it will then run the installer, make sure you have your token at hand to paste into the console.

The installer will create the `config.js` file for you.

## Starting the bot

To start the bot, in the command prompt, run the following command:
`node index.js`
